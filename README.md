## How It Works üîç

1. **Home Page**: When you open the application, you'll see a simple form where you can enter a YouTube video URL. Along with the URL, you can specify a path on your computer where the downloaded video will be saved. The save path has a default value set to `/storage/emulated/0/Download/Seal` for convenience (particularly if you‚Äôre testing on an Android device).

2. **Fetching Video Formats**: After entering the video URL and save path, clicking on the **"Fetch Formats"** button will query YouTube for available download formats (e.g., different resolutions, file types like MP4, MP3, and more). The server (using `yt-dlp`) retrieves these formats and presents them to the user for selection.

3. **Select Format and Download**: Once the formats are displayed, the user can select the preferred quality/format for the video. After selecting the format, they can click on **"Download Video"** to begin the download process.

4. **Download**: The video is downloaded to the specified location on the system. The video is retrieved using the selected format (resolution, file type, etc.) and saved to the local directory.
